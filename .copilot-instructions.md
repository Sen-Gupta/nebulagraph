## Docker Compose Commands

1. **Always use `docker compose` (with space) instead of `docker-compose` (with hyphen)**
   - ✅ Correct: `docker compose up -d`
   - ❌ Incorrect: `docker-compose up -d`
   - The hyphenated version is the legacy standalone tool, while the spaced version is the modern Docker CLI plugin
